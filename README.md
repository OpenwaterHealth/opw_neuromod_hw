# Open-TFUS Neuromodulation Platform

## Overview
Open-TFUS is an ultrasound platform designed to help qualified researchers transmit focused ultrasound beams into subject’s brains, so that those researchers can learn more about how different types of ultrasound beams interact with the neurons in the brain. Unlike other focused ultrasound systems which are aimed only by their placement on the head, Open-TFUS uses an array to precisely steer the ultrasound focus to the target location, while its small size allows transmission through the forehead.

The first application researched using this platform has been Neuromodulation, which is when brain activity in a specific part of the brain is enhanced or suppressed by the application of energy - in this case, ultrasound energy. Neuromodulation is unique in that the therapeutic effect can be achieved with Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LOFU), meaning that the energy levels needed to create the therapeutic effect are below the limits understood to be safe for diagnostic imaging. The exact level used, the timing of pulses, and where the beam(s) are aimed are up to the researcher and specific application, but Open-TFUS supports a wide range of acoustic parameters to support Neuromodulation and other focused ultrasound applications research.

A system built on open-TFUS is made of: 
* A headset containing an ultrasound transducer that is aimed through the forehead
* A system for recording the precise position of the transducer relative to the subject’s MRI 
* Software for computing what signals the transducer will have to send to treat the target
* Hardware for driving the transducer to generate those signals and deliver the treatment.
